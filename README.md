# Object_Pose_Change

## Object_Pose_Change Task Part-1
Segmenting the Prompted Object using Owl ViT (https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06230) / Owl V2 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09683) and SAM (https://segment-anything.com/) . Inspired by https://github.com/SalvoSamba01/prompt-image-segmentation/tree/main .

## Object_Pose_Change Task Part-2
Changing the Pose of the Segmented Object by positive azimuth/elevation angle and polar angle inspired by Zero123 Diffusion Model https://github.com/cvlab-columbia/zero123 ,it's Hugginface Implementation https://github.com/kxhit/zero123-hf and https://github.com/cvlab-columbia/zero123/issues/61#issuecomment-1637959103

## Object_Pose_Change Task Part-3
Impainting the CHanged Pose Object Back into Image (Coming Soon).

(PS: Everything Implemented on Kaggle)

## TODO

- [ ] Object_Pose_Change Task Part-3 Implement using SD (Stable Diffusion) 
- [ ] Handle and COrrect Version Dependencies to create a common enviroment
- [ ] Create a common environment.yml
- [ ] Create a Single Pipeline to Do all tasks based on parameter
- [ ] Testing for False Cases
- [ ] Improve Efficiency of Part-2
